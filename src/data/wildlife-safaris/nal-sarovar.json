    "long_description": "Nal Sarovar Bird Sanctuary, consisting primarily of a 120.82-square-kilometre lake and ambient marshes, is situated about 64 km to the west of Ahmedabad near Sanand Village, in the Gujarat state of India. Mainly inhabited by migratory birds in winter and spring, it is the largest wetland bird sanctuary in Gujarat, and one of the largest in India. It was declared a Ramsar site in 2012. The lake water is very shallow (4-8 ft), nurturing vast reed beds and aquatic plants, which serve as excellent food and shelter for birds. The sanctuary is famous for the congregation of flamingos that turn the lake pink.",
