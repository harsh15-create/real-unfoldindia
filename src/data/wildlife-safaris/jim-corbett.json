    "long_description": "Jim Corbett National Park, established in 1936 as Hailey National Park, has the glory of being India's oldest and most prestigious National Park. Spanning over 520 square kilometers in the Nainital district of Uttarakhand, it is a haven for wildlife enthusiasts and nature lovers. The park is famous for its distinct zones like Dhikala, Bijrani, and Jhirna, each offering unique topography ranging from hills, river belts, marshy depressions, grasslands, and a large lake. It was the launchpad for Project Tiger in 1973. The magical landscape of Corbett is well known and fabled for its tiger richness. Even then, the presence of the big cat is not the only attraction; the park is home to rare species like Otters and the endemic fish-eating crocodile, the Gharial.",
