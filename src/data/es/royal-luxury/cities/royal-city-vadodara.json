The Laxmi Vilas Palace here is four times the size of Buckingham Palace, a testament to the family's immense wealth and taste.\n\nWhile the main palace is a private residence and museum, the royal hospitality can be experienced at properties like Madhav Bagh. This 19th-century noble home offers a more intimate glimpse into the lifestyle of the Maratha aristocracy in Gujarat, blending Maharashtrian culture with Gujarati warmth.",
