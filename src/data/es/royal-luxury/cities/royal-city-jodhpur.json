    "long_description": "Jodhpur, the Blue City, stands at the edge of the Thar Desert, dominated by the colossal Mehrangarh Fort. Founded in 1459 by Rao Jodha, it is a city of warriors, palaces, and vibrant indigo-hued houses. The city is famous for its equestrian heritage, polo, and Marwari cuisine.\n\nThe crown jewel of Jodhpur's hospitality is Umaid Bhawan Palace, one of the world's largest private residences and a symbol of Art Deco grandeur. Staying here is an experience in royal living unmatched anywhere else. Beyond the main palace, Jodhpur offers boutique heritage stays in restored havelis like RAAS, which offer stunning views of the illuminated fort at night. A trip to Jodhpur is a journey into the heart of Rajputana valor and luxury.",
