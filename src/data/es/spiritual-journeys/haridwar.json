    "long_description": "Haridwar (Gateway to Hari/Vishnu) is one of the seven holiest places in India (Sapta Puri). It is the point where the River Ganges emerges from the Himalayas onto the North Indian plains. Consequently, the water here is icy cold, fast-flowing, and immensely purifying. \n\nHaridwar is ancient, mentioned in scriptures as Mayapuri. Unlike Rishikesh, which is more about yoga and solitude, Haridwar is about rituals, crowds, and raw devotion. It is chaos and divinity intertwined. The heart of the city is Har Ki Pauri ('Steps of the Lord'), the most sacred ghat where a drop of the elixir of immortality (Amrit) traditionally fell. Every evening, this ghat transforms into a spectacle of light and sound during the Ganga Aarti, where priests synchronize flaming lamps to the rhythm of bells and chants.\n\nThe city is massive during the Kumbh Mela, the largest human gathering on earth, occurring every 12 years. But even on ordinary days, Haridwar is a sea of pilgrims taking holy dips to wash away sins, performing rites for ancestors, and seeking blessings from the hilltop temples of Mansa Devi and Chandi Devi.",
    "spiritual_significance": "One of the four sites for the Kumbh Mela. It is believed to be one of the places where Amrit (nectar) fell from the celestial bird Garuda's pitcher. Taking a dip at Har Ki Pauri during auspicious times is considered the ultimate act of purification.",
