    "long_description": "Dudhwa National Park is located in the Terai belt of marshy grasslands of northern Uttar Pradesh, India. It represents one of the few remaining examples of the highly diverse and productive Terai ecosystem, supporting a large number of endangered species, obligate species of tall wet grasslands and species of restricted distribution. Together with the Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary and the Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, it forms the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve. The park is famous for the efforts of 'Billy' Arjan Singh, who introduced zoo-born tigers and leopards into the wild here. It is home to rhinos, tigers, swamp deer, and elephants.",
