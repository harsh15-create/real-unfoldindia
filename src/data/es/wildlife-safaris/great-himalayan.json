Spread over an area of 1,171 km², the park was established in 1984. It captures the essence of the Himalayas with its high ridges, deep gorges, alpine meadows, and glaciers. The park protects the watershed of the Tirthan and Sainj rivers. It is home to more than 375 species of fauna, including the Snow Leopard, Himalayan Brown Bear, and the Western Tragopan. Unlike other parks, GHNP is explored primarily by trekking, offering a raw and immersive wilderness experience.",
