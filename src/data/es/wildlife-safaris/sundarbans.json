    "long_description": "The Sundarbans National Park is a National Park, Tiger Reserve, and a Biosphere Reserve in West Bengal, India. It is part of the Sundarbans on the Ganges Delta, and adjacent to the Sundarban Reserve Forest in Bangladesh. The delta is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is one of the largest reserves for the Bengal tiger. It is also home to a variety of bird, reptile and invertebrate species, including the salt-water crocodile. The tiger population here has adapted to an aquatic life and can swim long distances in the saline waters. The unique ecosystem of the Sundarbans, with its tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests, makes it a globally significant ecological hotspot.",
