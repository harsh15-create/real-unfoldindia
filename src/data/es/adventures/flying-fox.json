    "short_description": "A gravity-fed aerial ride on a cable, often found in adventure parks.",
    "long_description": "While 'Ziplining' often refers to multi-line forest tours, 'Flying Fox' in the Indian context typically refers to single, high-speed, long-distance cable slides often found in adventure parks or specific scenic spots. The experience is simple: you are harnessed (either sitting or swimming position 'Superman style') and released from a high point to slide down towards a lower landing platform.\n\nRishikesh boasts one of Asia's longest Flying Foxes, where you accelerate to speeds of up to 140 km/h over the river valley. Unlike ziplining tours which involve hiking between lines, the Flying Fox is usually a 'one-and-done' extreme thrill ride, often done in tandem or triplets.",
