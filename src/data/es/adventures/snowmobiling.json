    "long_description": "Snowmobiling offers the thrill of speed on snow without the physical exertion of skiing. A snowmobile (or ski-doo) is a motorized vehicle with skis at the front and a caterpillar track at the back. \n\nIn India, this is largely a tourist activity available in Gulmarg (Phase 1), Rohtang Pass, and Solang Valley. You typically sit behind an operator who drives, but in some designated safe zones, you can drive yourself. It’s a loud, fast, and exciting way to explore the white desert of the Himalayas.",
