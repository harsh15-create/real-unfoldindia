    "long_description": "ATV (All-Terrain Vehicle) Quad Biking is a high-power off-road activity that puts you in the driver's seat of a 4-wheeled beast. Designed to tackle rough landscapes like sand dunes, muddy trails, and rocky hills, these machines are easy to handle (usually automatic gears) but powerful enough to give you a serious thrill.\n\nIndia offers diverse terrains for quad biking. In Jaisalmer and Nubra Valley, you can bash towering sand dunes. In Goa and Manali, tracks often involve forest trails and river crossings. It’s a raw, dusty, and loud experience that appeals to petrolheads and adventure lovers alike.",
