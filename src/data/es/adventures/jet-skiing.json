    "long_description": "Jet Skiing is the motorcycle riding of the sea. It uses a Personal Watercraft (PWC) to zip across water surfaces at high speeds. It is one of the most readily available water sports in India, found on almost every commercial beach.\n\nWhile most tourists experience this as a pillion rider with an instructor driving (for safety in crowded zones), several locations allow you to drive yourself under supervision. The thrill of cutting through waves, feeling the spray of salt water, and the raw power of the engine makes it an exhilarating short-duration adventure.",
