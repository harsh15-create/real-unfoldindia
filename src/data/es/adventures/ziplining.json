    "long_description": "Ziplining, also known as Flying Fox, uses gravity to propel you down a steel cable mounted on an incline. In India, this activity has transformed from a simple playground ride to a spectacular way to tour heritage sites and natural wonders. Imagine zipping from one turret of a 15th-century fort to another, or soaring 400 meters above the roaring Ganges river.\n\nThe most famous operator, Flying Fox (now often operating under various heritage partners), popularized 'heritage zips' in Rajasthan. These tours usually consist of multiple zip lines (5 to 6) that take you on a 2-hour aerial journey around a location. It requires less physical effort than climbing but delivers a fantastic rush of speed and height.\n\nModern zip facilities use international standard braking systems and harnesses, making it extremely safe. Participants are given a brief training on how to hold the trolley and control their body position before launching off the first platform.",
