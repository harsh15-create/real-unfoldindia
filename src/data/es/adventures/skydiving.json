    "long_description": "Skydiving is often considered the pinnacle of adventure sports. It involves jumping from an aircraft at altitudes ranging from 10,000 to 13,000 feet, experiencing freefall for about 45–60 seconds, and then gliding under a parachute for a gentle descent. The acceleration to terminal velocity (approx 200 km/h) provides an unmatched rush.\n\nIn India, skydiving is a relatively new but rapidly growing activity. While it doesn't yet have the widespread infrastructure of Dubai or New Zealand, dedicated drop zones in Narnaul (Haryana), Mysore, and occasionally at other airstrips offer world-class tandem jumps. The most common type for tourists is the 'Tandem Jump', where you are harnessed to a masterful instructor who handles the exit, freefall stability, and parachute deployment. You simply need to arch your back, smile for the camera, and enjoy the ride.\n\nFor those who want to take it up as a sport, 'Static Line' jumps and AFF (Accelerated Free Fall) courses are available, allowing you to jump solo after intensive ground training.",
