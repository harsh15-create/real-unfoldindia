    "long_description": "Alwar, one of the oldest kingdoms in Rajasthan, is a land of olive-green hills and marble cenotaphs. It serves as the gateway to Rajasthan and is known for the Sariska Tiger Reserve and the haunted Bhangarh Fort. \n\nThe royalty here is best experienced at Tijara Fort-Palace, a 19th-century marvel that was left unfinished and recently restored to glory. It sits atop a hill with commanding views of the mustard fields below. Staying in Alwar is about enjoying the quiet countryside, exploring ancient ruins, and experiencing the unique 'ruin-turned-resort' aesthetic that defines its heritage hospitality.",
