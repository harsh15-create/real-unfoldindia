    "long_description": "Orchha is a medieval town frozen in time on the banks of the Betwa River. Founded in the 16th century by the Bundela Rajput chief, Rudra Pratap, its name literally means 'Hidden Place'. The town is dotted with massive palaces, temples, and cenotaphs (chhatris) that have a hauntingly beautiful quality.\n\nA stay in Orchha is quieter and more atmospheric than other royal cities. Properties like Amar Mahal are built in the traditional Bundela architectural style, offering spectacular views of the ancient monuments. It is a place for slow travel, watching the sunset over the Betwa, and exploring palaces that still whisper stories of Ram Raja.",
