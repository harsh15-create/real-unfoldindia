    "long_description": "Udaipur, often called the 'Venice of the East', is arguably India's most romantic city. Founded in 1559 by Maharana Udai Singh II, it is set around a series of artificial lakes and is known for its lavish royal residences. The City Palace, overlooking Lake Pichola, is a monumental complex of 11 palaces, courtyards and gardens, famed for its intricate peacock mosaics.\n\nBut the true magic of Udaipur lies in living its history. Here, you can stay in palaces that seem to float on water, like the world-renowned Taj Lake Palace, or reside in the royal guest house of Shiv Niwas, where Queen Elizabeth II once stayed. The city's skyline is dominated by domes and turrets, and its narrow streets are filled with the color and craft of Rajasthan. A royal stay in Udaipur is not just about luxury; it is about stepping into a painting of Rajput valour and grandeur.",
