    "long_description": "Pandharpur in Maharashtra is the seat of the Varkari tradition, a devotional movement emphasizing simplicity, love, and equality. The deity here is Vithoba (or Vitthal), a form of Lord Krishna standing on a brick with hands on his hips, waiting for his devotee Pundalik. \n\nThe town is synonymous with the 'Wari', an annual pilgrimage where lakhs of devotees (Varkaris) walk hundreds of kilometers from Alandi and Dehu to Pandharpur, singing Abhangas (hymns) of Saints Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram. This ocean of humanity, carrying saffron flags and clashing cymbals, culminates in Pandharpur on Ashadi Ekadashi.\n\nThe temple of Lord Vitthal is unique because it allows 'Pad sparsh' darshan—devotees can rest their heads on the feet of the Lord's idol, a rare intimacy allowed in Hindu temples (though queues for this can take 24 hours!). The Chandrabhaga river (Bhima river) flowing in a crescent shape adds to the sanctity.",
