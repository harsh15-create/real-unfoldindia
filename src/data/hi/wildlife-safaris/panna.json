    "long_description": "Panna National Park is located in Panna and Chhatarpur districts of Madhya Pradesh in India. It has an area of 542.67 km2. It was declared in 1994 as the twenty-second Tiger Reserve of India and the fifth in Madhya Pradesh. Panna was known for its lack of tigers in 2009 due to poaching, but thanks to a highly successful relocation program from Bandhavgarh and Kanha, it now boasts a healthy tiger population. The Ken River, which flows through the park, creates spectacular scenery including waterfalls and is home to the Mugger and Gharial crocodiles. The park is also famous for its 7 vulture species.",
