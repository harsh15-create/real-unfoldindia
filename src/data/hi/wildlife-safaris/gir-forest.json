    "long_description": "Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, also known as Sasan Gir, is a forest and wildlife sanctuary near Talala Gir in Gujarat, India. It is the only place in the world outside Africa where a lion can be seen in its natural habitat. Established in 1965, the total area of the sanctuary is 1,412 km². The park is a mix of scattered scrub and open deciduous forest, providing an ideal terrain for the Asiatic Lion. The lions of Gir are a majestic sight, and thanks to dedicated conservation efforts, their population has seen a steady increase. Apart from lions, Gir is home to a significant population of leopards, sambar deer, chital, and over 300 species of birds.",
