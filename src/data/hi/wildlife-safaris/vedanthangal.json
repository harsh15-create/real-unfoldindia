    "long_description": "Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary is located in the Madurantakam taluk of the Chengalpattu District in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. vedanthangal means 'hamlet of the hunter'. It is one of the oldest water bird sanctuaries in the country. The sanctuary has been protected by the local population for more than 250 years, who realized that the bird droppings falling into the lake water created liquid guano, acting as a fertilizer for their fields. The sanctuary involves a 30-hectare lake dotted with Barringtonia trees, where thousands of birds nest during the winter.",
