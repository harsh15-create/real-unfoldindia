Named after the Pench River that flows through it, dividing it into two halves, the park covers 758 sq km. It is famed for its wolf population (the source of Mowgli's family myth), as well as tigers, leopards, and herds of deer. The landscape is an open canopy of teak forests and mixed vegetation, making wildlife viewing easier than in denser jungles.",
