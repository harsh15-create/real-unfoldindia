    "long_description": "Munnar is a town in the Western Ghats mountain range in India’s Kerala state. It is synonymous with rolling hills that are carpeted with emerald-green tea plantations, contoured, clipped and sculpted like ornamental hedges. The low mountain scenery is magnificent and you’re often up above the clouds watching veils of mist clinging to the mountaintops. Munnar is also famous for the Neelakurinji flowers, which bloom once every 12 years and turn the hills blue.",
