    "long_description": "Scuba diving opens up the remaining 70% of the planet—the underwater world. In India, the Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep offer world-class diving comparable to the Maldives or Thailand. Crystal clear blue waters, vibrant coral gardens, and teeming marine life including turtles, manta rays, and reef sharks await.\n\nFor beginners, the 'Discover Scuba Dive' (DSD) is the most popular option. It requires no swimming skills; a dedicated instructor holds you and manages your equipment while you breathe underwater and marvel at the sights. For those looking to get certified, PADI/SSI Open Water courses are widely available.\n\nMainland India also has diving spots—Goa (Grand Island) and Netrani Island (Karnataka) are popular, though visibility is generally lower than the islands. Pondicherry has created unique artificial reefs, making it a great spot for training.",
