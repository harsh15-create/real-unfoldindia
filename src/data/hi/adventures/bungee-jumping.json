    "long_description": "Bungee Jumping is the ultimate test of courage. It involves jumping from a tall structure (cliff, bridge, or crane) while connected to a large elastic cord. The free-fall creates a massive adrenaline spike, followed by the rebound where you are pulled back up, oscillating until all kinetic energy dissipates.\n\nRishikesh is home to India's highest fixed-platform bungee jump (83 meters), operated by Jumpin Heights. The facility is set amidst the stunning view of the Hall river valley and follows New Zealand safety standards. Goa also has a notable jump spot at Mayem Lake (55 meters). Safety is paramount in Bungee; reputable operators use redundant systems and highly trained jump masters to ensure a zero-accident record.",
