    "long_description": "Jamdani is a hand-loom woven fabric made of cotton, which was historically referred to as muslin. The Jamdani weaving tradition differs from other weaving techniques because the embroidery thread is not continuous; it is a supplementary weft technique. \n\nThe weaver uses a non-structural weft in addition to the standard weft that holds the warp threads together. The sheer quality of the fabric coupled with the intricate, artistic designs makes it highly prized.",
