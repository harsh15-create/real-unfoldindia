It is believed to have been introduced by Nur Jahan, the wife of Mughal emperor Jahangir. \n\nTraditionally done on white muslin cloth with white thread (White-on-White), it now uses colorful threads and various fabrics like georgette, chiffon, and cotton. The embroidery involves over 30 different stitches, including the famous shadow work (Bakhiya) where the thread work is done on the reverse side to create a shadow effect on the front.",
