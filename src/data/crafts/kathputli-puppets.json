The puppets are carved from a single piece of wood (head and torso), painted with large expressive eyes, and dressed in bright Rajasthani clothes. \n\nThey are controlled by a single puppeteer using strings attached to his fingers. The shows dwell on historical tales of bravery (like Amar Singh Rathore) and social issues.",
