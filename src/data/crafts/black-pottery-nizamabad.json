    "long_description": "Nizamabad in Azamgarh district of Uttar Pradesh is famous for its unique black pottery. The pottery gets its lustrous black color from a special firing process in a closed kiln where smoke (carbon) is trapped and impregnates the clay. \n\nAfter firing, the grooves engraved on the pottery are filled with a silvery powder made of zinc and mercury (though now often tin or lead amalgam), creating a striking contrast against the shiny black surface. The finish resembles the Bidriware metal craft but is made of clay.",
