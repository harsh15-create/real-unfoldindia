    "long_description": "Madhubani art (or Mithila painting) is practiced in the Mithila region of Bihar and Nepal. Traditionally done by women on freshly plastered mud walls of their homes, it has now moved to canvas and paper. \n\nThe paintings are characterized by eye-catching geometrical patterns. There are no gaps left in the painting; the empty spaces are filled with flowers, animals, birds, and geometric designs. The themes mostly revolve around Hindu deities like Krishna, Ram, Shiva, and Durga, and natural objects like the sun and moon.",
