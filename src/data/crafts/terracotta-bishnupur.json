    "long_description": "Bishnupur in West Bengal is famed for its terracotta temples built by the Malla kings in the 17th and 18th centuries. Since stone was scarce in the alluvial plains of Bengal, artisans turned to the abundant clay to create bricks and decorative panels. \n\nThe Bankura Horse, with its long erect neck and pointed ears, is the most famous product of this region and serves as the logo of Indian handicrafts. The craft involves creating hollow figures (for easier firing) and intricate relief work depicting scenes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and social life.",
