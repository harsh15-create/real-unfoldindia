The craft was invited by Tipu Sultan who invited artisans from Persia to train locals. \n\nThe toys are made of soft Ivory Wood (Aale mara), turned on a lathe, and polished with natural vegetable dyes mixed with lacquer (Lac). The process ensures the toys are non-toxic and child-safe. They are smooth, rounded, and brightly colored.",
