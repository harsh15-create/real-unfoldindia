Thangkas are traditionally kept unframed and rolled up when not on display, mounted on a textile backing somewhat in the style of Chinese scroll paintings, with a further silk cover on the front.\n\nThey serve as important teaching tools depicting the life of the Buddha, various influential lamas, and other deities and bodhisattvas. The art is strictly governed by iconographic rules.",
