    "long_description": "Warli painting is a style of tribal art mostly created by the tribal people from the North Sahyadri Range in Maharashtra. The paintings are rudimentary and use a very basic graphic vocabulary: a circle, a triangle, and a square. \n\nTraditionally done on mud walls using rice paste (white) on a red ochre background, Warli art depicts social life rather than mythological characters. Scenes of hunting, dancing (Tarpa dance), sowing, and harvesting are common. The philosophy is one of harmony with nature.",
