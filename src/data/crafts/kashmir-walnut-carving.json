    "long_description": "Kashmir is the only region in India where walnut trees grow, and thus walnut wood carving is unique to this state. The wood is hard and durable, with a close grain and uniform texture that facilitates fine, detailed carving. \n\nStyles of carving include 'Undercut' (Khoul) where the design is in high relief, 'Deep Cut', and 'Shallow Cut'. The motifs are invariably flora and fauna of the valley—chinar leaves, vine leaves, flowers, and pears.",
