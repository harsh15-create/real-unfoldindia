The Gonds believe that viewing a good image begets good luck.\n\nThe distinctive feature of Gond art is the use of patterns (dots, dashes, fish scales, curves) to fill the images. These patterns, known as 'Signature Patterns', often identify the artist. The subjects are largely drawn from nature (animals, trees) and their mythology.",
