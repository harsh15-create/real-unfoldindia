    "long_description": "Kalamkari literally means 'Pen Craft' (Kalam + Kari). While there are two styles, the Srikalahasti style is the one that is strictly 'drawn' using a bamboo pen (Kalam), and is thus considered a painting form. \n\nOriginating in the temples of Srikalahasti, these paintings depict epic narratives from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas. The artist uses a bamboo stick with a bundle of fine hair attached to one end as a brush/pen. The entire process uses natural vegetable dyes and involves multiple stages of washing and boiling the fabric.",
