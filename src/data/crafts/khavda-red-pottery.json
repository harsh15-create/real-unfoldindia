    "long_description": "Khavda pottery is an ancient art form from holding strong in the village of Khavda, North Kutch. The men bring the mud from the lakeside and shape it using a potter's wheel into various vessels. Once dried, the women of the house perform the painting.\n\nUsing a red slip (Gairu) as a base, they paint intricate designs in black and white. The black color consists of bamboo ash, while the white is made from white clay. The pottery is then fired, resulting in the signature terra-cotta color with distinct tribal motifs. It is deeply connected to the daily life of the region, used for storing water and cooking.",
