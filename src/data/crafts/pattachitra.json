This art form is closely related to the cult of Shri Jagannath and the temple traditions in Puri. \n\nThe canvas is prepared by coating cotton cloth with a mixture of chalk and gum made from tamarind seeds. It is then rubbed with two different stones to make it smooth and shiny. The paintings are known for their intricate details, bold lines, and lack of landscapes or perspective. The themes are chiefly mythological, revolving around Lord Jagannath and the Vaishnava sect.",
