    "long_description": "Kalighat painting originated in the 19th century around the Kalighat Kali Temple in Kolkata. It started as a souvenir for pilgrims but evolved into a powerful medium of social commentary. \n\nThe style is characterized by bold, sweeping brushstrokes, rhythmic lines, and vibrant colors. Unlike traditional miniatures, Kalighat paintings often depicted secular themes, social satire (Babu culture), and domestic scenes along with gods and goddesses.",
