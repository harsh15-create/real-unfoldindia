    "long_description": "Blue Pottery is widely recognized as a traditional craft of Jaipur, though it is Turko-Persian in origin. The name comes from the eye-catching cobalt blue dye used to color the pottery. It is one of the few pottery techniques in the world that does not use clay. Instead, the dough for the pottery is prepared by mixing quartz stone powder, powdered glass, Multani Mitti (Fuller's Earth), borax, gum, and water.\n\nThe technique was brought to India by early Muslim rulers and later patronized by the Maharajas of Jaipur. It is a fragile but beautiful art form, primarily used for decorative items like vases, bowls, plates, and tiles. The distinctive blue color (derived from cobalt oxide) and green (from copper oxide) against a white background give it its cool, refreshing look.",
