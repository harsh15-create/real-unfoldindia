The craft dates back over 500 years. \n\nArtisans draw silver into extremely thin wires and then twist and shape them into intricate designs—ranging from jewelry to large replicas of temples and chariots. No soldering is visible; the wires are fused or tied efficiently. It requires immense patience and steady hands.",
