    "long_description": "Surfing is exploding in India, transforming quiet fishing villages into vibrant surf towns. With over 7,000 km of coastline, the subcontinent offers fantastic waves for beginners and intermediates, with a few world-class reef breaks for experts.\n\nMulki (Karnataka), Mahabalipuram (Tamil Nadu), and Varkala (Kerala) are the epicenters of this culture. Surf schools here are run by ISA (International Surfing Association) certified instructors who emphasize safety and ocean awareness. The vibe is laid-back: wake up early, catch the morning swell, eat healthy, do yoga, and repeat.\n\nUnlike the massive, intimidating waves of Hawaii, Indian waves are generally mellower (3-5 feet), making it one of the best places in the world to learn the sport. The warm water means you can often surf in boardshorts without a wetsuit.",
