    "long_description": "White water river rafting is one of the most popular group adventure sports in India. It involves navigating a river in an inflatable raft, paddling in unison to overcome turbulent currents and rapids. The sport demands teamwork, quick reflexes, and a spirit of adventure.\n\nRishikesh is undoubtedly the rafting capital of India, where the Holy Ganges offers rapids ranging from easy Grade I to thrilling Grade IV sections like 'The Wall' and 'Three Blind Mice'. But rafting isn't just a Himalayan activity. In the west, the Kundalika River in Kolad (Maharashtra) offers year-round rafting thanks to dam-released waters. For the truly adventurous, the Zanskar River in Ladakh offers multi-day expeditions through frozen gorges.\n\nRafting trips usually differ by distance (12km, 16km, 24km) and difficulty. Most commercial operators provide a helmet, life jacket, and paddle, along with a certified guide in every raft who steers and shouts commands.",
