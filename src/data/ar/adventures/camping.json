    "long_description": "Camping in India has moved beyond hardcore trekking. 'Leisure Camping' is now a massive trend, allowing families and friends to experience the outdoors without walking for days with a backpack. From luxury 'Glamping' in Jaisalmer's deserts to lakeside tents in Maharashtra and riverside camps in Rishikesh, the options are endless.\n\nCamping offers a digital detox, bonfires, stargazing, and waking up to bird calls. Bhandardara in Maharashtra is famous for massive firefly congregations in May-June, creating a magical bioluminescent forest around your tent. Jaisalmer offers cultural evenings with folk dance alongside tent stays.",
