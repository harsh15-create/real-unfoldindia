    "long_description": "Sandboarding is snowboarding's dusty cousin. It involves shredding down sand dunes on a waxed board. The sport is gaining popularity in the deserts of Rajasthan, where the dunes of Sam (Jaisalmer) provide the perfect slopes. It’s harder than it looks—sand has high friction, so maintaining speed requires steep gradients and good balance.\n\nIt’s a fantastic fun activity, often hilarious as falls are soft and sandy. Unlike snow, sand is available year-round (though summers are scorching), and you don't need heavy cold-weather gear—just a t-shirt and grit.",
