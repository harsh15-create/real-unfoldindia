    "long_description": "Snorkeling is the most accessible way to witness the magic of the underwater world. Unlike scuba diving, which requires heavy gear and training, snorkeling requires just a mask, a snorkel tube, and fins. You float on the surface, face down, observing the reefs and fish below.\n\nIndia's islands—Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep—offer world-class snorkeling where reefs start right from the beach (shore snorkeling). You can simply walk into waist-deep water and be surrounded by colorful fish. For more pristine reefs, boat snorkeling trips take you deeper into the sea to clearer spots.\n\nIt is a perfect activity for families, children, and those sensitive to deep water pressure. Guides usually accompany snorkelers with a floating ring to assist non-swimmers, making it effortless and safe.",
