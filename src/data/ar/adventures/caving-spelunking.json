    "long_description": "Caving (Spelunking) is the exploration of natural cave systems. It is adventure in its purest, rawest form—crawling through narrow passages (squeezes), wading through underground rivers, and marveling at stalactites and stalagmites formed over millions of years.\n\nMeghalaya is the caving capital of India, home to some of the longest and deepest caves in the world, like Krem Liat Prah. The Caving in the Abode of the Clouds Expedition (CACE) attracts international explorers annually. For tourists, accessible caves like Mawsmai offer a glimpse, while guided adventure tours take you deeper into the dark, wet limestone mazes of the Jaintia Hills.",
