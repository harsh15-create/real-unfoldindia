Located in the Sawai Madhopur district of southeastern Rajasthan, it is famous for its Bengal Tiger population, often spotted basking in the sun or hunting near the ancient ruins of Ranthambore Fort. The park's diverse landscape comprises dry deciduous forests and open grassy meadows, dotted with several lakes and rivers. Ranthambore offers a unique blend of nature and history, where wild cats roam freely amidst cenotaphs, ruins, and the majestic 10th-century fortress that towers over the park.",
