    "long_description": "Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary (also known as Pakshi Kashi of Karnataka), is located in the Mandya District of the state of Karnataka in India. It is the largest bird sanctuary in the state, only 40 acres in area, and comprises six islets on the banks of the Kaveri River. Ranganathittu is the result of a small dam across the river which created islets where birds began to nest. Noted ornithologist Salim Ali observed that the islets formed an important nesting ground for a large variety of birds, and persuaded the Wodeyar kings of Mysore to declare the area a protected area in 1940. It is a breeding ground for Painted Storks, Pelicans, and Spoonbills.",
