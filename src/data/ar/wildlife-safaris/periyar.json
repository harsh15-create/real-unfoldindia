It is notable as an elephant reserve and a tiger reserve. The park is often called the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary or Thekkady. It is set high in the Cardamom Hills and Pandalam Hills of the south Western Ghats along the border with Tamil Nadu. The sanctuary surrounds the Periyar Lake, a reservoir formed when the Mullaperiyar Dam was constructed in 1895. The park is known for its herds of Asian elephants who come to bathe in the lake.",
