    "long_description": "Kaziranga National Park, located in the heart of Assam, is one of the last areas in eastern India undisturbed by a human presence. It is inhabited by the world's largest population of one-horned rhinoceroses, as well as many mammals, including tigers, elephants, panthers and bears, and thousands of birds. The park spans over 430 square kilometers of elephant grass, marshland, and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests, crisscrossed by four major rivers, including the Brahmaputra. It is a brilliant example of dedicated conservation efforts, having saved the one-horned rhino from the brink of extinction. The sheer visibility of wildlife here is unmatched, making every safari a rewarding experience.",
