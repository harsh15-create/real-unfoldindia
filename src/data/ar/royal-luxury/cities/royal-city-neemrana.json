    "long_description": "Neemrana is synonymous with its majestic 15th-century Fort-Palace, which rise from the stark landscape of the Aravalli ranges. Once a ruin, it is now the flagship of heritage restoration in India. The town itself is an ancient historical site, but the primary attraction is the experience of living in a medieval fort that has been lovingly restored tier by tier.\n\nLocated just a few hours from Delhi, it offers a quick escape into history. The fort is built over 14 levels and features hanging gardens, two pools, and India's first zip-line, making it a perfect blend of adventure and royalty. Every corner of the fort holds a secret, from the subterranean passages to the panoramic terraces.",
