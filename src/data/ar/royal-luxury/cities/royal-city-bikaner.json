    "long_description": "Bikaner is a vibrant desert city located in the heart of the Thar Desert. Known for its distinct red sandstone architecture, it was founded in 1488 by Rao Bika. The city is a treasure trove of culture, famous for its savory snacks (Bikaneri Bhujia), intricate Usta art, and the majestic Junagarh Fort.\n\nThe royal experience in Bikaner is unique. It offers stays in some of the most grand and architecturally significant palaces in Rajasthan, like the Indo-Saracenic Laxmi Niwas Palace. Newer boutique properties like Narendra Bhawan curate a modern royal lifestyle, blending the eclectic tastes of the last Maharaja with contemporary luxury. Bikaner is an understated gem, offering grandeur without the crowds.",
