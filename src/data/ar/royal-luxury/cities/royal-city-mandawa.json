    "long_description": "Mandawa is the heart of the Shekhawati region, often called the 'Open Art Gallery of Rajasthan'. It is famous for its profusion of painted havelis, where every inch of the walls is covered in intricate frescoes depicting mythology, history, and even modern inventions like trains and cars.\n\nThe town grew in the 18th century as a trading outpost for wealthy merchants. Today, it offers a surreal experience of living in these painted mansions. Castle Mandawa, the town's fortress, stands tall as a guardian of this heritage, offering a unique stay where medieval turrets meet modern hospitality. Walking through Mandawa is like walking through a storybook illustrated by the finest artists of a bygone era.",
