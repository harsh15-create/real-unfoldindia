    "long_description": "Jaisalmer, the Golden City, rises from the Thar Desert like a mirage in sandstone. Dominated by the 12th-century Jaisalmer Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that is still inhabited, the city feels like a medieval kingdom frozen in time. The intricate havelis with their lace-like stone carvings are a testament to the skill of local artisans (silavats).\n\nStaying in Jaisalmer is about experiencing the desert's mystique. From the fortress-like luxury of Suryagarh that offers a gateway to the Thar, to the historic Mandir Palace within the city, the hospitality here is legendary. Nights are best spent under a canopy of stars on the sand dunes, listening to folk music that echoes through the silence of the desert.",
