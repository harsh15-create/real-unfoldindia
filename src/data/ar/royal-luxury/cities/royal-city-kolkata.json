    "long_description": "Kolkata, the former capital of British India, is a city of crumbling grandeur and intellectual soul. Beyond the colonial capital, the countryside is dotted with the palaces ('Rajbaris') of the Zamindars (landlords) who accumulated immense wealth and built European-style mansions.\n\nThe royal offering here is the Rajbari experience. Places like The Rajbari Bawali have turned these decaying mansions into luxury resorts. It is an experience of 'Opium Bengali' luxury—four-poster beds, high ceilings, classical music, and feasts that last for hours. It is a nostalgic journey into the era of the Babus.",
