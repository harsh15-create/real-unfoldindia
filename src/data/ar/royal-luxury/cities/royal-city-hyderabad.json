Their legacy is one of refined culture, exquisite cuisine, and palaces that defy imagination.\n\nThe crown jewel is the Taj Falaknuma Palace. Perched 2000 feet above the city, it is aptly named the 'Mirror of the Sky'. Once the royal residence of Nizam Mehboob Ali Khan, it is now one of the world's most luxurious hotels. Staying here is a journey into the lavish lifestyle of the Nizams, replete with horse-drawn carriages, rose-petal welcomes, and dining at a table that seats 101 guests.",
