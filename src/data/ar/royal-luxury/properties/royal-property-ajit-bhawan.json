    "long_description": "Ajit Bhawan, built in 1927 exclusively for Major General Maharaj Dhiraj Sir Ajit Singh ji, the younger brother of Maharaja Umaid Singh ji of Jodhpur, is recognized as India's first heritage hotel. It stands as an oasis of hospitality and Rajput charm.\n\nThe palace is a red sandstone marvel, elegant yet imposing. Unlike the colossal Umaid Bhawan, Ajit Bhawan has a more intimate, sylvan feel, with rooms arranged as small cottages within lush gardens. It showcases a collection of royal artifacts, hunting trophies, and vintage cars, preserving the legacy of the Rathore dynasty.",
