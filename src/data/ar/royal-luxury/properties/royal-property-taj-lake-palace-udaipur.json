    "long_description": "Built in 1746 by Maharana Jagat Singh II as 'Jag Niwas', the Taj Lake Palace is one of the most romantic hotels in the world. Floating on the tranquil waters of Lake Pichola, this white marble palace was famously used as the lair of the Bond villain Octopussy, but its reality is far more serene.\n\nThe palace was restored to its pristine glory by the Taj Group, making it a benchmark for world-class hospitality and regal living. Every room offers breathtaking views of the neighbouring City Palace, Aravalli Hills, Machla Magra Hills, and Jag Mandir. The custodians of the palace, the Royal Butlers, are descendants of the original palace retainers and provide a service that is both discreet and impeccable.\n\nStaying here is not merely about luxury; it is about inhabiting a piece of Mewari history. Guests arrive by private boat, are showered with rose petals upon entry, and can dine on platform floats in the middle of the lake. It is a fairy-tale experience that seamlessly blends the grandeur of the past with modern comforts.",
