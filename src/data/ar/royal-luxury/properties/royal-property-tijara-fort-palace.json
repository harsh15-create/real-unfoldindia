    "short_description": "A 19th-century fort-palace with terraced gardens, offering a magical stay above the plains.",
    "long_description": "Tijara Fort-Palace is a dream in stone. Begun in 1835 by Maharaja Balwant Singh, it was left unfinished due to his untimely death. It remained a ruin until it was taken over and painstakingly restored by the Neemrana group. Today, it stands as a magnificent heritage hotel with four terraced gardens (hanging gardens) that are a marvel of landscaping.\n\nThe fort offers suites named after India's leading painters and designers, reflecting a deep aesthetic sensibility. The Hawa Mahal and Mardana Mahal wings offer stunning views of the surrounding countryside. It is a place of immense quiet and beauty, perfect for those looking to disconnect and float above the world.",
