    "long_description": "Amar Mahal is built on the foundations of a traditional Bundela Rajput palace. Located strategically with a view of the cenotaphs and the river Betwa, it captures the essence of Orchha's medieval grandeur. The architecture features arched doorways, hanging balconies, and open courtyards typical of the region.\n\nWhile possessing the charm of an old palace, it offers modern luxury. The rooms are decorated with Bundela paintings and artefacts. The view of the sunset hitting the Chhatris from the hotel's terrace is a photographer's delight. It serves as the perfect base for exploring the Jahangir Mahal and Ram Raja Temple.",
