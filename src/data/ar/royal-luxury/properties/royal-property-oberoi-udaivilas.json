    "long_description": "Spanning over 30 acres on the banks of Lake Pichola, The Oberoi Udaivilas stands on the 200-year-old hunting grounds of the Maharana of Mewar. This resort offers an experience that is truly regal, with its intricate layout of interconnecting domes and corridors that reflect the layout of Udaipur itself—whose seven lakes are linked by canals.\n\nAccommodation at Udaivilas is spacious and luxuriously appointed, with many rooms featuring semi-private pools and terraces that offer views of the historic City Palace and Jagmandir. The resort is renowned for its impeccable service, verdant gardens, and a wildlife sanctuary where peacocks and deer roam free.",
