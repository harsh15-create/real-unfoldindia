Known for having one of the world's most expensive suites, The Shahi Mahal, the hotel is a celebration of gold leafed ceilings, ivory furniture, and crystal chandeliers.\n\nIt has been awarded as the 'World's Leading Heritage Hotel' by the World Travel Awards multiple times. Guests can dine using gold and silver crockery, relax in the stunning swimming pool, and explore the on-site crockery museum, making it a living museum of Rajput history.",
