    "long_description": "The Rambagh Palace in Jaipur, often referred to as the 'Jewel of Jaipur', is a living legend. Originally built in 1835 on a modest scale, it was converted into a hunting lodge and pleasure house before becoming the principal residence of the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II. Today, expertly managed by Taj Hotels, it offers a glimpse into the lifestyle of the royals.\n\nSpread over 47 acres of manicured gardens, the palace is an architectural masterpiece with scalloped arches, cupolas, sandstone balustrades, and lush courtyards. Peacocks strut across the lawns, and guests can play polo on the grounds or indulge in a vintage car drive. The Suvarna Mahal, the former palace ballroom, provides a dining experience straight out of the gilded age, complete with huge crystal chandeliers and gold-plated tableware.",
