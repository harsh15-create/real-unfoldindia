    "long_description": "RAAS Jodhpur is Jodhpur's first boutique hotel, located at the northeastern base of the magnificent Mehrangarh Fort. The hotel comprises four restored heritage buildings in the city's famous red sandstone, united by modern structures that frame the breathtaking views of the fort. It is a stunning example of how heritage can be fused with contemporary luxury.\n\nThe Haveli itself dates back to the late 18th century. RAAS has brought it back to life with a design that respects its history while adding a layer of modern chic. The central courtyard, with its swimming pool and ancient trees, creates an oasis of calm right in the middle of the bustling walled city.",
