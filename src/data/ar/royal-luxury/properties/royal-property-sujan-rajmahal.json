    "long_description": "Suján Rajmahal Palace is one of the most treasured palaces in Jaipur, originally built in 1729 by the Maharaja of Jaipur. It has served as the British Residency and the private home of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II. Today, it has been reimagined by the Suján dynasty and designer Adil Ahmad into a masterpiece of maximalist interior design.\n\nThe palace is a visual feast, famous for its 46 custom wallpapers that tell stories of Jaipur's history. It retains the soul of a private home while offering the service of a world-class hotel. It has hosted legends like Queen Elizabeth II and Jackie Kennedy, and continues to be the address for the modern jet-set.",
