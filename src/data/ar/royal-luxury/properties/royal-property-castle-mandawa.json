    "long_description": "Castle Mandawa is a 17th-century fortress that dominates the skyline of Mandawa. Built by Thakur Nawal Singh, it is a classic example of Rajput architecture with its painted domes, arched gateways, and cannon-mounted ramparts. \n\nThe castle offers a fascinating glimpse into the past with its collection of family portraits, antique cannons, and period furniture. The Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience) features stunning glasswork, while the rooms are adorned with original frescoes. Staying here feels like living in a museum, surrounded by the art and history of the Shekhawati region.",
