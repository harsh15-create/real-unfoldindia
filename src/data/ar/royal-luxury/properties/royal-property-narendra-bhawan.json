Born in 1948, he was a modern royal, a traveler, and a man of eclectic tastes. The hotel is designed as a narrative of his life, from his memories of Bikaner to his travels across Europe.\n\nThis is not a traditional palace hotel; it is a 'Design Hotel' set in a palace. The interiors are a riot of colors, textures, and curios. With an infinity pool overlooking the city, a moody clinic-themed spa, and dining experiences that range from colonial to contemporary, Narendra Bhawan offers a fresh, chic take on royalty.",
