After attaining enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, the Buddha came here to the Deer Park (Isipatana) to deliver his first sermon, 'The Turning of the Wheel of Dharma', to his five former companions.\n\nSarnath is dominated by the massive Dhamek Stupa, a solid cylinder of brick and stone standing 43.6 meters high, marking the spot of the sermon. The ruins of ancient monasteries, the Ashoka Pillar (whose lion capital is India's national emblem), and the Mulagandha Kuti Vihara create an archaeological park that feels suspended in time. It is a place to sit on the green lawns, watch the deer, and contemplate the teachings of compassion and mindfulness.",
