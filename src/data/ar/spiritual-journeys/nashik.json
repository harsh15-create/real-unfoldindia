    "long_description": "Nashik is a city of duality—ancient spirituality meeting modern vineyards. Situated on the banks of the Godavari River (often called the Ganga of the South), it is one of the four locations for the massive Kumbh Mela held every 12 years. It sits at the foothills of the Western Ghats and is associated deeply with the Ramayana; 'Nashik' derived from 'Nasika' (nose) refers to the incident where Lakshmana cut off Surpanakha's nose here.\n\nThe spiritual anchor of the region is Trimbakeshwar, located about 30km away. It houses one of the 12 Jyotirlingas, unique for its three-faced lingam representing Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. The Godavari river originates from the Brahmagiri hills near here. \n\nInside Nashik city, the Panchavati area is where Lord Rama believed to have stayed during his exile. The Sita Gufaa (cave) and Kalaram Temple are major pilgrimage spots. The Ramkund ghat is the focal point where pilgrims take holy dips and immerse ashes of the departed.",
