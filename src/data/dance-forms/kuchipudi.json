    "long_description": "Kuchipudi originates from a village of the same name in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. Unlike other classical forms where the dancer is distinct from the actor, Kuchipudi is a dance-drama where performers (historically men, even for female roles) sing and speak dialogue while dancing.\n\nIt is known for its fast footwork, graceful body movements, and expressive eye play. A unique feature of Kuchipudi is 'Tarangam', where the dancer balances a pot on their head while dancing on the rim of a brass plate, showcasing immense control and balance.\n\nThe dance combines 'Lasya' (grace) and 'Tandava' (vigor) and is deeply rooted in the Bhakti movement.",
