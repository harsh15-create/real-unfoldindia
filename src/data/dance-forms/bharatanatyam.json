    "short_description": "One of the oldest classical dance forms, known for its fixed upper torso, bent legs, and spectacular footwork.",
    "long_description": "Bharatanatyam is widely regarded as the oldest surviving classical dance tradition in India. Originating in the temples of Tamil Nadu, it was originally performed by female temple dancers called Devadasis and was known as Dasi Attam. The name Bharatanatyam is often interpreted as a combination of three concepts: Bha-va (Expression), Ra-ga (Main Melody), and Ta-la (Rhythm), with Natyam meaning dance.\n\nThis art form is renowned for its sculptural poses, the grounded stance known as 'Aramandi' (half-sit), and intricate footwork that creates a complex rhythmic interplay with the accompanying music. The dance is traditionally a solo performance that narrates stories from Hindu mythology, particularly those of Lord Shiva, Krishna, and the Goddess. \n\nThe repertoire is divided into Nritta (pure dance with rhythm and movement), Nritya (combination of rhythm and expression), and Natya (dramatic element). A traditional recital, or Margam, follows a specific order starting with Alarippu (an offering of flowers) and concluding with Tillana (a fast-paced rhythmic piece).\n\nOver the centuries, Bharatanatyam has evolved from temple precincts to royal courts and finally to public stages, becoming a symbol of India's cultural identity globally.",
