For centuries, it was nurtured and preserved within the 'Sattras' (monasteries) by male monks (Bhokots).\n\nIn the modern era, it has moved from the monastery to the metropolitan stage and is now performed by women as well. The dance is devotional in nature, describing the deeds of Krishna and Rama.",
