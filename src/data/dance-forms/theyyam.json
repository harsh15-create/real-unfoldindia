Originating in North Malabar (Kannur/Kasargod), it predates Hinduism and involves the worship of ancestors, heroes, and nature spirits.\n\nThe performance creates a surreal atmosphere with red face painting, massive headdresses (some up to 30 feet tall), and hypnotic drumming. Towards the end, the 'Theyyam' blesses the devotees. It is arguably the most spectacular and intense ritual art form in India.",
