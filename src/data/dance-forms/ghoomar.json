    "long_description": "Ghoomar is a traditional folk dance of the Bhil tribe performed to worship Goddess Sarasvati which was later embraced by other Rajasthani communities. The dance is chiefly performed by veiled women who wear flowing dresses called 'Ghagara'. The dance typically involves performers pirouetting while moving in and out of a wide circle. The word 'Ghoomna' describes the twirling movement of the dancers and is the basis of the word Ghoomar.\n\nIt is often performed on special occasions, such as weddings, festivals, and religious occasions. The dance is measured by the rhythmic clapping and singing, and the tempo increases as the dance progresses.",
