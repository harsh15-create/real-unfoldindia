    "long_description": "Garba is a form of dance which originates from the state of Gujarat in India. The name is derived from the Sanskrit term 'Garbha' (womb) and 'Deep' (lamp). Many traditional Garbas are performed around a centrally lit lamp or a picture/statue of the Goddess Shakti. \n\nTraditionally, it is performed during the nine-day Hindu festival Navratria. Both men and women dance in concentric circles, clapping their hands to the rhythm of the music. It symbolizes the cycle of time (from birth to death to rebirth) revolving around the one true constant - the Goddess.",
