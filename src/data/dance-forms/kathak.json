    "long_description": "Kathak is the major classical dance form of Northern India, deriving its name from the Sanskrit word 'Katha' which means story. The Kathakars were originally traveling bards who used dance and song to recount the great epics. Over time, it evolved in the Mughal courts, absorbing Persian influences which gave it a unique blend of Hindu and Muslim cultural elements.\n\nKey features of Kathak include intricate footwork (tatkar), rapid pirouettes (chakkars), and a straight-legged stance. Unlike other Indian classical forms that use bent knees, Kathak is performed standing straight. The dance focuses heavily on rhythm and the interplay with the Tabla and Pakhawaj. It has three main Gharanas (schools): Lucknow, Jaipur, and Banaras, each emphasizing different aspects like expression or technical brilliance.\n\nKathak is mesmerizing for its dizzying spins and the delicate nuances of facial expression (abhinaya) used to depict thumris and ghazals.",
