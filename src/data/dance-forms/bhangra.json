Originating in the Majha area of Punjab, it was traditionally associated with the Vaisakhi festival, celebrating the harvest. Men perform Bhangra to the beat of the Dhol (large drum), executing vigorous kicks, leaps, and body movements. \n\nThough initially a harvest dance, it has evolved into a staple for weddings and celebrations worldwide. The signature move is the raising of hands/shoulders to the beat and the 'Balle Balle' chant.",
