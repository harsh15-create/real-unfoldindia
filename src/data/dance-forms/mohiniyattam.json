Legend says Lord Vishnu took the form of Mohini to enchant the demons and retrieve the nectar of immortality. \n\nThe dance is characterized by 'Andolika' (swaying) movements that resemble palm leaves swaying in the breeze or waves of the ocean. It adheres to the Lasya style (graceful, feminine). The costume is a distinct white saree with gold borders (Kasavu), and the hair is tied in a side bun. It sits somewhere between the vigor of Kathakali and the structure of Bharatanatyam.",
