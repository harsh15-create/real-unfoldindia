    "long_description": "Odissi is one of the eight classical dance forms of India, originating from the temples of Odisha. It is distinguished by the 'Tribhangi' (three-bent) posture, which divides the body into three parts—head, bust, and torso—creating a sensuous S-curve. \n\nRelated largely to the Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odissi was historically performed by Maharis (temple maids). The dance form was revived in the mid-20th century by gurus like Kelucharan Mohapatra. It is highly lyrical and sculptural, often compared to 'poetry in motion' or the frozen fluidity of the sculptures found in Konark and Puri temples.\n\nThe repertoire typically includes Mangalacharan (invocation), Batu (pure dance), Pallavi (elaboration of melody), Abhinaya (expressional dance often based on Jayadeva's Gita Govinda), and Moksha (liberation/finale).",
