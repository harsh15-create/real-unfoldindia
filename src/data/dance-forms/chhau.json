It is a unique form of masked dance (in the Purulia and Seraikella styles) that uses vigorous martial movements to enact stories from epics. The Mayurbhanj style of Odisha uses no masks. \n\nThe dance is performed during the Chaitra Parva festival and depicts themes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The movements are inspired by combat techniques (Parikhanda) and animal gaits (Chalis). It involves high leaps, somersaults, and rapid footwork.",
