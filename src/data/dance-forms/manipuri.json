    "long_description": "Manipuri dance, also known as Jagoi, originates from the northeastern state of Manipur. It is distinct from other Indian classical forms due to its emphasis on sinuous, curvilinear movements and the absence of sharp, stiff gestures. The feet never strike the ground hard; movements are light and floating, resembling the swaying of trees.\n\nThe most famous repertoire is the Raslila, depicting the cosmic dance of Krishna and the Gopis. The costumes are unique, particularly the stiff, cylindrical mirror-work skirt (Kumil) worn by female dancers. Another vigorous aspect is the Pung Cholom, where male dancers play the Pung (drum) while performing acrobatic jumps and spins.",
