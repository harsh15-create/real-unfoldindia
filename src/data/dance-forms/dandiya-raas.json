It involves men and women dancing with colorful wooden sticks (dandiyas) in their hands. The striking of sticks creates a rhythmic accompaniment to the music. \n\nSymbolically, it represents the battle between Goddess Durga and the demon Mahishasura (the sticks represent swords). It is slightly different from Garba, which is hand-clapping and singing, though both are performed at the same events.",
