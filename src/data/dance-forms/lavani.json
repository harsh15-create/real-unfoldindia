It is a combination of traditional song and dance, which particularly performed to the beats of 'Dholki', a percussion instrument. Lavani is noted for its powerful rhythm and erotic sentiment. Lavani has contributed substantially to the development of Marathi folk theatre. \n\nLavani is performed by women wearing a nine-yard saree. The songs are sung in a quick tempo. Originating from the Peshwa rule in the 18th century, it was a morale booster for tired soldiers.",
