    "long_description": "Kathakali is a vibrant dance-drama from Kerala known for its larger-than-life costumes and elaborate makeup (Vesham). 'Katha' means story and 'Kali' means play. It evolved in the 17th century and is rooted in the martial art form Kalaripayattu, which influences its physical training and flexibility.\n\nKathakali is strictly purely a male-dominated art (traditionally), where men play female roles too, though this is changing. It is a 'total theatre' blending dance, music, acting, and makeup. The makeup codes are complex: 'Pacha' (Green) for noble heroes like Rama, 'Kathi' (Knife) for anti-heroes like Ravana, and 'Thadi' (Beard) for varying evil or hunter characters.\n\nThe actor does not speak; the story is sung by vocalists (Ponnani and Singidi), and the actor interprets it through Mudras (hand gestures) and Navarasas (facial expressions), with eyes playing a crucial role.",
