It is found in the coastal districts of Karnataka. \n\nYakshagana literally means the song (gana) of the Yaksha (nature spirits). It is a night-long performance where actors wear massive headgears and elaborate costumes to enact stories from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas. Unlike Kathakali, actors in Yakshagana speak dialogues (often improvised) in addition to dancing.",
