The variety is staggering, ranging from the milk-based sweets of Bengal (Chenna) to the ghee and flour-based indulgences of the North and the jaggery-coconut treats of the South.\n\nKey ingredients include milk (khoa), ghee, sugar, jaggery, nuts, and aromatic spices like cardamom, saffron, and rose water. Every festival puts a spotlight on specific sweets.",
