    "long_description": "Street food in India is not just a cheap meal; it's a way of life, a cultural phenomenon that transcends social boundaries. Every city, town, and village has its own street food culture, often centered around bustling markets, railway stations, and religious sites.\n\nThe most ubiquitous category is 'Chaat'—a family of savory snacks that originated in North India (Uttar Pradesh/Delhi) known for their complex flavor profile: spicy, tangy, salty, sweet, and crunchy all at once. Ingredients like potatoes, chickpeas, crisp fried dough, yogurt, and tamarind chutney are staples. Beyond Chaat, street food includes substantial meals like Vada Pav in Mumbai (the Indian burger), Chowmein (Indian Chinese), Rolls in Kolkata, and Idli-Dosa in the South. It is fresh, prepared largely in front of you, and incredibly affordable.",
