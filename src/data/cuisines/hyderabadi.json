    "long_description": "Hyderabadi cuisine is a princely legacy of the Nizams of Hyderabad. It is a perfect amalgamation of North Indian (Mughlai), Turkish, and Arabic influences with the native Telugu culinary traditions of the Deccan plateau. The result is a cuisine that uses the richness of dry fruits and meat from the Mughals but marries it with the sourness (tamarind/lemon) and spiciness of the South.\n\nThe crown jewel is the 'Hyderabadi Biryani', distinct for its 'Dum' style of cooking where meat and rice are slow-cooked together in a sealed pot. Another hallmark is the use of unique ingredients like gongura leaves, tamarind, and coconut. The cuisine is also famous for 'Haleem', a slow-cooked stew of meat, lentils, and wheat, primarily consumed during Ramadan.",
