    "long_description": "Bengali cuisine, originating from West Bengal and Bangladesh, is the only multi-course tradition in the Indian subcontinent that follows a specific serving order similar to French cuisine (à la russe). It emphasizes the balance of sweet and spicy flavors and is renowned for its diverse use of freshwater fish and vast repertoire of milk-based desserts.\n\nThe staple food is rice and fish. The unique flavor profile comes from 'Panch Phoron'—a five-spice mix of fenugreek, nigella, cumin, black mustard and fennel seeds—and the pungent kick of mustard oil. A typical meal starts with a bitter preparation (Shukto), followed by lentils (Dal) and vegetables, then fish (Machh), meat, chutney, and finally, dessert (Mishti). The region is often called the 'Land of Sweets' (Mishti) for introducing Rasgulla and Sandesh to the world.",
