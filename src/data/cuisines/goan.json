    "long_description": "Goan cuisine is a vibrant amalgamation of its Konkani roots and 450 years of Portuguese colonial influence. It is famous for its intense flavors, characterized by the use of coconut, rice, fish, pork, and local spices like Kokum (a sour fruit). The Portuguese introduced potatoes, tomatoes, pineapples, cashews, and chillies to Goa (and India), which are now integral to the cuisine.\n\nThe food is divided into two main styles: Hindu Goan (uses kokum and tamarind for sourness, less onion/garlic) and Catholic Goan (uses vinegar for sourness, includes pork/beef). Seafood is a staple, with Kingfish (Visvan) being the favorite. Bread (Pao) is also essential, eaten with everything from tea to curries.",
