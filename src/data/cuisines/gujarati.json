    "long_description": "Gujarati cuisine is one of the oldest culinary treasures of India and is primarily vegetarian, though some communities (like the Bohras) eat meat. It is unique for its extensive use of sugar or jaggery in almost all dishes, creating a subtle sweet-salty-spicy balance. The cuisine changes proportionally with the region: Kathiawar (spicy), Surat (sweet/salty), and Kutch (simple).\n\nThe typical Gujarati meal is a 'Thali'—a large silver platter consisting of Rotli (bread), Dal or Kadhi (yogurt soup), Rice (Bhat), and 'Shaak/Sabzi' (vegetable curries). A distinguishing feature is 'Farsan' (steamed or fried snacks) served alongside the meal. Gujarati food is also known for being low on oil but high on flavor, often tempered with mustard seeds, cumin, and curry leaves.",
