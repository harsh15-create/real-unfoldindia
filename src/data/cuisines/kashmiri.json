    "long_description": "Kashmiri cuisine, often referred to as Wazwan, is a regal culinary tradition from the beautiful Kashmir Valley. Known for its rich, aromatic flavors, it heavily utilizes yogurt, saffron, Kashmiri red chilies (for color rather than heat), and dry fruits.\n\nThe cuisine is heavily influenced by Central Asian and Persian traditions. Meat, particularly lamb/mutton, plays a central role, cooked in various styles ranging from the milk-based Yakhni to the fiery Rogan Josh. The painstaking preparation of a Wazwan, a multi-course meal often consisting of up to 36 dishes, is considered an art form.",
