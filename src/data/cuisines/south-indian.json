    "long_description": "While 'South Indian' is a broad term covering distinct cuisines from four major states, this category focuses on the universally loved comforts found across the region: fermented rice and lentil dishes, tangy tamarind-based stews (Sambar, Rasam), and the ubiquitous coconut chutney. \n\nIt differentiates itself with the use of curry leaves, mustard seeds, and asafoetida. From the crispy Dosas of Tamil Nadu to the fluffy Idlis and the energizing Filter Coffee of Karnataka, these foods have become global ambassadors of Indian cuisine.",
