    "long_description": "Maharashtrian cuisine is incredibly diverse, ranging from the mild, coconut-based flavors of the Konkan coast to the fiery, spice-laden dishes of the Vidarbha and Kolhapur regions. It famously balances sweet, sour, and spicy tastes. \n\nStaples include jowar and bajra bhakris (millet flatbreads), rice, and lentils. Mumbai, the capital, contributes its own legendary street food culture, while cities like Pune and Nagpur offer distinct regional specialties. The cuisine is also known for its 'upvas' (fasting) foods like Sabudana Khichdi.",
