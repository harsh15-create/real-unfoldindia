    "long_description": "Punjabi cuisine is one of the most distinct and popular Indian cuisines, coming from the region of Punjab situated in Northern India and Pakistan. It offers a vast variety of delectable and exotic vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes that are prepared with varied traditional culinary styles, particularly the tandoori style. The cuisine is characterized by its rich, buttery flavors, extensive use of dairy products like milk, cream, butter, and ghee (clarified butter), and whole spices.\n\nThe Tandoor (a traditional clay oven) is central to Punjabi cooking, imparting a unique smoky flavor to breads like Naan, Roti, and Kulcha, as well as meat dishes like Tandoori Chicken. Punjabi cuisine is also famous for its hearty 'Dhabas' (roadside eateries) which serve wholesome, rustic food. The staples include wheat, maize (corn), and mustard greens, with 'Sarson da Saag' and 'Makki di Roti' being the most iconic seasonal dish, consumed during winters.",
