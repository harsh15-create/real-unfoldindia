    "long_description": "Rajasthani cuisine is a splendid example of how geography influences food. Originating from the arid desert region of Western India, it developed to rely less on water and green vegetables and more on milk, buttermilk, ghee, and pulses. The cooking style is rich and spicy, designed to withstand the harsh desert climate.\n\nThe cuisine is split broadly into two traditions: the vegetarian fare of the Marwaris, who follow strict dietary rules, and the non-vegetarian specialties of the Rajputs, the warrior class who loved their game meat. Key ingredients include gram flour (besan), lentils, millet (bajra), and corn. Spices like red chili, turmeric, and coriander are used generously. The most iconic dish is 'Dal Baati Churma', a hearty combination of baked wheat balls, lentils, and sweetened cereal.",
