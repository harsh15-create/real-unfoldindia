    "long_description": "Kerala, known as the 'Land of Spices', offers a cuisine that is earthy, aromatic, and diverse. Shaped by its history as a spice trade hub and its distinct geography (coastline and backwaters), the food leans heavily on coconut (oil, milk, grated), rice, tapioca, and seafood. \n\nThe cuisine varies across communities: Hindus are known for the vegetarian 'Sadhya' feast, Christians for their stews and meat dishes (beef/pork), and Muslims (Mappilas) for their rich Biryanis and pathiris. Spices like black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and ginger are cultivated locally and used generously. Coconut oil is the primary cooking medium, giving dishes a distinct aroma.",
