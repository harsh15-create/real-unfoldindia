    "long_description": "Ayodhya, situated on the banks of the Sarayu River in Uttar Pradesh, is one of the most religiously significant cities in India. As the birthplace of Lord Rama, the seventh avatar of Vishnu, it is the setting for the epic Ramayana. For ages, Ayodhya has been a symbol of faith, patience, and devotion. With the construction of the grand Ram Mandir, the city has witnessed a spiritual renaissance, drawing millions of pilgrims from across the globe to witness the return of their King.\n\nThe city retains an old-world charm, with temples around every corner, sadhus chanting 'Siyavar Ramchandra Ki Jai', and the Sarayu river flowing calmly, carrying the prayers of devotees. Ayodhya is not just about one temple; it is a complex of sacred sites associated with the life of Rama, Sita, and Hanuman. From the fortress-like Hanuman Garhi to the serene Kanak Bhawan, every stone here tells a story of duty (Dharma) and devotion (Bhakti). \n\nAyodhya is also culturally rich, celebrating festivals like Deepotsav (Diwali) with unparalleled grandeur, lighting millions of lamps to recreate the welcome of Lord Rama returning from exile. It is a place to reconnect with the roots of Indian civilization and reflect on the ideals of the 'Ram Rajya'—an ideal state of justice and virtue.",
    "spiritual_significance": "Ayodhya is the first of the seven Moksha-dayini puris (cities that grant liberation). It is the Janmabhoomi (birthplace) of Lord Rama. The Sarayu river is considered as holy as the Ganges; a dip here is believed to wash away sins. It is a central pilgrimage for Vaishnavites.",
