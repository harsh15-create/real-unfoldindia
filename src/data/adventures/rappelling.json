    "short_description": "Descend vertical rock faces or waterfalls using ropes and technical gear.",
    "long_description": "Rappelling (abseiling) is the controlled descent off a vertical drop, such as a rock face, using a rope. While climbing is about going up, rappelling is the thrill of coming down. In India, this activity has spawned a unique and thrilling variant: Waterfall Rappelling (Canyoning).\n\nDuring the monsoon, seasonal waterfalls in the Western Ghats (Maharashtra) become hotspots for this. Imagine descending a 100-foot slippery rock face with a roaring waterfall pounding against your helmet. It's an intense sensory experience combining the fear of heights with the force of water. Dry rappelling is also popular in Manali and Rishikesh as part of adventure camps.",
