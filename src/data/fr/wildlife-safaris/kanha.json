    "long_description": "Kanha National Park, located in the Maikal range of Satpuras in Madhya Pradesh, is a vast expanse of grassland and forest. It is one of the most well-maintained National Parks in Asia. The park created history with its success in saving the Barasingha (Hard-ground Swamp Deer) from near extinction. The lush sal and bamboo forests, grassy meadows, and ravines of Kanha provided inspiration to Rudyard Kipling for his famous novel 'The Jungle Book'. It is a prime tiger reserve and offers excellent opportunities for sighting tigers, leopards, wild dogs, and the rare Barasingha.",
