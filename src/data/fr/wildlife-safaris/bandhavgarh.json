    "long_description": "Bandhavgarh National Park, situated in the Umaria district of Madhya Pradesh, is a place of mythological and historical significance. The ancient Bandhavgarh Fort is of great importance as it is believed to have been gifted by Lord Rama to his younger brother Lakshmana. The park boasts one of the highest densities of tiger populations in India, making it one of the best places to spot the big cat. The terrain is broken by a series of rocky hills, covered with sal forests and grasslands. It used to be the hunting ground of the Maharajas of Rewa and is famous as the origin of all white tigers in captivity around the world.",
