    "short_description": "Built in 1904, this red sandstone palace is a masterpiece of craftsmanship and royal history.",
    "long_description": "Laxmi Niwas Palace was commissioned by His Highness Sir Ganga Singh ji in 1904. Designed by Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob, it is the most perfect example of Indo-Saracenic architecture in India. The palace was built to host dignitaries and royalty, including King George V and Queen Mary.\n\nThe palace is breathtaking with its intricate red sandstone carving, hand-painted friezes, and gold-laden walls. Staying here is not just luxury; it is living in a museum. The rooms are cavernous, the corridors echo with history, and the central courtyard is a marvel of artistic stonework. It remains the residence of the Royal Family of Bikaner.",
