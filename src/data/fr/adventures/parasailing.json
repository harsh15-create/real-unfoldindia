    "short_description": "Enjoy a bird's eye view of the sea while being towed by a speedboat.",
    "long_description": "Parasailing offers the thrill of flying with the safety of being tethered to a boat. As the speedboat accelerates, the parachute (parasail) fills with air and lifts you 200–300 feet into the sky. It is one of the most popular beach activities in India because it requires zero skill—you just sit in a harness and enjoy the view.\n\nFrom up high, the noise of the boat fades away, leaving you with a silent, stunning panorama of the coastline, the endless ocean, and the tiny people on the beach below. Winch-boat parasailing (where you take off and land directly on the boat deck) is the safer and more modern standard used in places like Goa and Andaman, ensuring you don't even get wet unless you ask for a 'dip'.",
