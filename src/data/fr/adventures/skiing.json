    "long_description": "Skiing in India is an underrated gem. While Europe and North America are famous, the Indian Himalayas offer some of the highest ski slopes in the world with deep, fresh powder. Gulmarg in Kashmir is the crown jewel, serviced by the famous Gondola ride that takes you up to 3,980 meters (Phase 2), offering massive off-piste terrain for experts.\n\nFor beginners, Auli (Uttarakhand) and Solang Valley (Manali) provide gentler, groomed slopes with ski schools. The season is short but intense, turning these mountain meadows into white wonderlands. Whether it's learning the 'pizza' (snowplough) technique or shredding backcountry powder, skiing here is an adventure combined with Himalayan hospitality.",
