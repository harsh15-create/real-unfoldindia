    "short_description": "Peaceful aerial views of deserts, forts, and national parks at sunrise.",
    "long_description": "Hot air ballooning is adventure tourism at its most regal. Unlike the adrenaline-pumping rush of skydiving or paragliding, ballooning offers a serene, almost meditative experience. Drifting silently with the wind at varying altitudes, you get a bird's-eye view of India's spectacular landscapes—be it the royal forts of Rajasthan, the rugged boulders of Hampi, or the dense forests of wildlife reserves.\n\nFlights typically take place at sunrise or sunset when the winds are calmest. The experience begins with watching the giant envelope being inflated with burners—a spectacle in itself. Once airborne, the basket floats gently, sometimes skimming treetops and other times rising thousands of feet for a panoramic vista. There is no engine noise, only the occasional roar of the propane burner keeping you aloft.\n\nSafety standards for ballooning in India are stringent, with pilots required to hold valid commercial licenses and equipment subject to regular DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) checks. It’s a perfect activity for families, couples, and photographers looking for a unique perspective on India's heritage.",
