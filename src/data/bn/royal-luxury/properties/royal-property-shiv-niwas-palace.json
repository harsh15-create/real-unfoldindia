    "long_description": "The Shiv Niwas Palace, a Grand Heritage Palace of the HRH Group of Hotels, is an architectural marvel. Crescent-shaped and built in the early 20th century during the reign of Maharana Fateh Singh, it was originally reserved for visiting dignitaries and guests of the House of Mewar. Today, it opens its doors to guests who wish to experience the lifestyle of royalty.\n\nLocated within the City Palace complex, the suites at Shiv Niwas are adorned with original furniture and portraits that have been in the royal family for generations. The palace surrounds a pool and a marble courtyard, offering a secluded yet central retreat. It famously hosted Queen Elizabeth II and featured in the James Bond movie 'Octopussy'.",
