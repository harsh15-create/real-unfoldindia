Built as a sun-kissed fortress in the middle of the arid landscape, it preserves the traditions of the past with a modern luxurious twist. The architecture is imposing, with massive ramparts, moats, and intricate stone carvings that rival the city's ancient havelis.\n\nThe hotel is famous for its unique curated experiences, from 'Dinner on the Dunes' under the stars to the 'Silk Route Exploration'. It is a place where every stone tells a story, and the silence of the desert is the ultimate luxury. It has become a premier destination for celebrity weddings and those seeking an escape into the extraordinary.",
