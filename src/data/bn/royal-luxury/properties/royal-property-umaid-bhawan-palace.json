    "long_description": "Umaid Bhawan Palace is the last of the great palaces of India and one of the largest private residences in the world. Built between 1928 and 1943 during the reign of Maharaja Umaid Singh, it was designed by majestic Edwardian architect Henry Lanchester. The palace is a blend of eastern and western architectural influences, featuring a central cupola that rivals the Taj Mahal.\n\nThe palace is divided into three parts: the residence of the royal family, a museum focusing on the 20th-century history of the Jodhpur Royal Family, and the Taj Hotel. Guests at the hotel are treated to a life of unparalleled luxury, with Art Deco style rooms, strolling peacocks in the gardens, and the unique experience of living with royalty.",
