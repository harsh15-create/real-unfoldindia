    "long_description": "Madhav Bagh is a hidden gem in Vadodara. Built in 1896 by Shrimant Madhavrao Gaekwad, it is a classic example of Indo-Saracenic architecture. The home has been lovingly restored by the family, who still live there and host guests.\n\nUnlike a commercial hotel, a stay here is personal. You are a guest of the family. The rooms are filled with heirlooms, and the food is home-cooked Maharashtrian cuisine (the Gaekwads are Marathas). It offers a quiet, dignified, and authentic experience of nobility that is rare to find.",
