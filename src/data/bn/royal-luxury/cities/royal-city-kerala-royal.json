    "long_description": "Kerala's royalty is subtle, defined by elegance, wood architecture, and a deep connection to nature. Unlike the stone fortresses of the north, Kerala's palaces are masterpieces of timber, tucked away in coconut groves or facing the backwaters.\n\nThe royal experience here is intimate. Properties like Chittoor Kottaram offer a 'single-key' experience, meaning you are the only guest in the Raja's palace. It is a journey into the life of the Cochrane and Travancore kings—quiet, understated, but profoundly luxurious. Expect private boat rides, barefoot luxury, and meals served on banana leaves with white-gloved service.",
