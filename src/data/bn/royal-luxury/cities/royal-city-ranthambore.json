Once the private hunting grounds of the Maharajas of Jaipur, today it is one of the best places in the world to see tigers in the wild.\n\nThe royal experience here is glamping at its finest. Properties like Oberoi Vanyavilas evoke the spirit of the royal caravans of old. Hand-stitched tents with teak floors, private gardens, and personal butlers offer a level of comfort that defies the rugged surroundings. It is about waking up to the call of the wild and ending the day with champagne under the stars.",
