    "long_description": "Gwalior is a city built around an impregnable fort that was once described as the 'pearl amongst fortresses in India'. It is the seat of the Scindia dynasty, one of the most powerful Maratha royal families. The city is a blend of medieval majesty and 19th-century European influence.\n\nThe royal highlight is the Taj Usha Kiran Palace. Built to host the King of England, it is a property of immense history and charm. Adjacent to the Jai Vilas Palace (part of which is still the royal residence), a stay in Gwalior offers a peek into the lifestyle of a modern royal family that has seamlessly transitioned into the present day.",
