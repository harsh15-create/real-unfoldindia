    "long_description": "Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. It is a day of immense joy, thanksgiving, and community. The day begins with the sighting of the new moon, signaling the start of the Shawwal month. In the morning, thousands of Muslim men dressed in blinding white kurtas gather at mosques (Idgahs) for a special congregational prayer—a synchronized display of faith that is moving to witness.\n\nAfter prayers, the streets come alive. People embrace three times in the traditional 'Eid Mubarak' greeting. The air fills with the aroma of 'Sewiyan' (sweet vermicelli pudding) and slow-cooked Biryani. It is a day of breaking barriers; non-Muslim friends and neighbors are invited to feasting tables. Charity (Zakat al-Fitr) is a mandatory pillar, ensuring even the poor can celebrate. In cities like Delhi and Hyderabad, the festive food walks around the mosques are legendary.",
