    "long_description": "Chapchar Kut is a spring festival held once the demanding work of clearing bamboo forests for shifting cultivation (jhum) is complete, giving farmers time to relax and celebrate. It is one of Mizoram’s biggest cultural events, symbolising gratitude for nature and community unity. Chapchar Kut is a perfect entry point into Mizo culture, with almost everything—dance, music, food, and clothing—on display in one festival. For travellers, Aizawl during Chapchar Kut feels like a living cultural showcase, yet remains friendly and small‑scale compared with more commercialised festivals elsewhere.",
