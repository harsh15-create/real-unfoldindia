    "long_description": "Ganesh Chaturthi celebrates the birth of the beloved elephant-headed deity, Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles. While celebrated across India, nowhere is the fervor as intense as in Mumbai and Pune. The festival begins with the installation of beautifully crafted clay idols in homes and public 'pandals'.\n\nFor ten days, the cities vibrate with the sound of bells and devotional songs (Aartis). The public pandals compete to create the largest idols—Lalbaugcha Raja in Mumbai being the most famous, attracting millions of devotees. The climax is Anant Chaturdashi, the immersion day (Visarjan). Millions spill onto the streets, dancing to drumbeats around trucks carrying the idols to the sea, chanting 'Ganpati Bappa Morya!', bidding the God farewell with a promise to return next year. It is a spectacle of faith, noise, color, and overwhelming energy.",
