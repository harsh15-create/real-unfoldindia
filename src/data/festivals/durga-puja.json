    "long_description": "Durga Puja is more than a festival; it is a massive socio-cultural event, particularly in Eastern India. It marks the victory of Goddess Durga over the buffalo demon Mahishasura, symbolizing the power of good over evil. For five days, the city of Kolkata preserves no sleep. It transforms into an open-air art gallery where thousands of 'pandals' (temporary marquees) display stunning craftsmanship, housing life-size clay idols of the Goddess.\n\nSimultaneously, in Western India (Gujarat), the festival is celebrated as Navratri (Nine Nights), dedicated to dance. People dressed in colorful chaniya cholis and kediyus gather in thousands to perform Garba and Dandiya Raas, dancing in concentric circles around a clay lamp. The rhythmic clapping and swirling colors make it one of the most energetic festivals in the world.\n\nWhether it’s the artistic grandeur of Bengal's pujo or the rhythmic fervor of Gujarat's garba, this period honors Shakti—the feminine cosmic energy.",
