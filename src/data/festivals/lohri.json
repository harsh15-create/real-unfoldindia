    "short_description": "A warm, energetic winter harvest festival of Punjab, celebrated with bonfires, folk songs, and popcorn.",
    "long_description": "Lohri is the winter folk festival of Punjab, celebrated primarily by Sikhs and Hindus. It marks the end of the winter solstice and the harvesting of the rabi crops. The central ritual involves a huge bonfire lit at sunset. People gather around the fire, tossing sesame seeds, jaggery, and popcorn into the flames as offerings to Agni (Fire God) to pray for prosperity and fertility.\n\nIt is especially auspicious for families who have had a marriage or a childbirth in the past year; they host grand celebrations. The beat of the Dhol (drum) is irresistible, leading to energetic Bhangra and Gidda dance performances. Lohri is communal, warm, and distinctly 'Punjabi'—full of heart, heavy food (Sarson da Saag and Makki di Roti), and high spirits.",
