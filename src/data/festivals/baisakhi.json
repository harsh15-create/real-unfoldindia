    "long_description": "Baisakhi marks the wheat harvest in North India and is also the day when Guru Gobind Singh founded the Khalsa in 1699, making it central to Sikh identity. It works as both a new year festival for many Punjabis and a day of religious renewal in gurdwaras. Villages and towns host fairs with food stalls, bhangra and gidda folk dances, and dhol drumming that turn Baisakhi into a high‑energy cultural carnival. For travellers, it is one of the best times to see Punjabi culture in full color, from brightly embroidered outfits to powerful bhangra performances.",
