    "long_description": "The Rath Yatra in Puri, Odisha, is one of the oldest and most spectacular processions in the world. It involves Lord Jagannath (Lord of the Universe), his brother Balabhadra, and sister Subhadra stepping out of their temple to visit their aunt's house, the Gundicha Temple. This journey is made on three colossal wooden chariots (Raths), the main one being 45 feet tall. \n\nWhat makes this unique is that typically, non-Hindus are not allowed inside the Jagannath Temple. The Rath Yatra is the only time the deities come out to give darshan (blessings) to everyone, regardless of caste or creed. Pulling the thick ropes of the chariot is considered an act of great merit. The energy is frantic and devotional, with shouts of 'Jai Jagannath' rising above the sound of gongs and cymbals.",
