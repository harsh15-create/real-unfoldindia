    "long_description": "Christmas in India is a beautiful blend of colonial traditions and local Indian customs. While celebrated by Christians across the country, the vibe in Goa, Kerala, and Mumbai is particularly festive. In Goa, a former Portuguese colony, the weeks leading up to Christmas are filled with carol singing, baking of 'Kuswar' (Christmas sweets), and decorating homes with paper stars.\n\nThe Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve is the spiritual centerpiece, where churches are packed to capacity. In the North East states like Meghalaya and Nagaland, the celebrations are deeply community-centric with feasts and choral music. Unique Indian touches include using banana or mango leaves for decoration and serving spicy pork vindaloo or duck roast alongside the traditional plum cake.",
