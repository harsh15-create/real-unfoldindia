    "long_description": "Guru Nanak Jayanti, also known as Gurpurab, marks the birth of the first Sikh Guru and the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak Dev Ji. It is one of the most sacred festivals in Sikhism. The celebrations begin two days earlier with the 'Akhand Path', a 48-hour non-stop reading of the Guru Granth Sahib (holy book). \n\nOne day before Gurpurab, a massive procession called 'Nagar Kirtan' is organized, led by the 'Panj Pyaras' (Five Beloved Ones) holding the Sikh flag. The streets resound with the singing of hymns and display of martial arts (Gatka). On the day of the festival, Gurdwaras (Sikh temples) are beautifully illuminated. The spirit of 'Seva' (service) is paramount; volunteers prepare and serve 'Langar' (community meal) to everyone, regardless of caste or religion, symbolizing equality.",
