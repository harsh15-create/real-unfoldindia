    "long_description": "Chhath Puja is an ancient Hindu Vedic festival dedicated to the Sun God (Surya) and Chhathi Maiya. It is unique because it involves no idols and no priests; the devotee alone performs the rituals. Predominantly celebrated in Bihar, Jharkhand, and UP, it is a four-day period of extreme purity and discipline. \n\nThe main rituals involve fasting without water for 36 hours and standing in waist-deep water to offer 'Arghya' (oblations) to the setting sun (Sandhya Arghya) and the rising sun (Usha Arghya). The offerings include seasonal fruits, sugarcane, and the famous 'Thekua' (sweet wheat cookie), all arranged in bamboo winnows. It is a mesmerizing sight to see millions of women in colorful sarees standing in the river as holding their offerings, waiting for the sun's rays.",
