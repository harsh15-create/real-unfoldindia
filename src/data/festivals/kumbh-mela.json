    "long_description": "The Kumbh Mela is not just a festival; it is a phenomenon. Recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, it is the largest peaceful gathering of pilgrims in the world, with tens of millions attending over several weeks. Hindu mythology states that during a battle between gods and demons for the pot (Kumbh) of nectar of immortality, four drops fell on Earth at Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain. The festival rotates between these four sites.\n\nThe most iconic image of the Kumbh is the 'Shahi Snan' (Royal Bath), where thousands of Naga Sadhus (naked ascetics), smeared in ash and wielding tridents, charge into the river at the auspicious hour. For the ordinary pilgrim, a dip in the holy river during the Kumbh is believed to liberate them from the cycle of birth and death (Moksha). The site becomes a temporary mega-city with tents, hospitals, and logistical marvels.",
