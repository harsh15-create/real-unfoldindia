    "long_description": "Dussehra, also known as Vijayadashami, marks the conclusion of the nine-day Navratri festival. It celebrates two major mythological victories: Lord Rama killing the ten-headed demon king Ravana, and Goddess Durga defeating the buffalo demon Mahishasura. In North India, the festival is a dramatic affair. Giant paper-and-bamboo effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhakarna, and his son Meghanada—often filled with firecrackers—are set ablaze in open grounds (Ramlila Maidan) amidst cheering crowds, symbolizing the destruction of evil.\n\nIn the south, particularly in Mysore, the vibe is regal. The Mysore Dasara is legendary for its elephant procession (Jumboo Savari) carrying the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari in a golden howdah. The Mysore Palace is illuminated with nearly 100,000 light bulbs, a breathtaking sight. In the Kullu valley of Himachal Pradesh, hundreds of local deities are brought down from mountain villages in colorful palanquins to pay homage to Lord Raghunath, creating a week-long congregation of gods and humans.",
