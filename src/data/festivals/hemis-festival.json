    "long_description": "Held at the Hemis Gompa, the largest and richest monastery in Ladakh, this two-day festival celebrates the birth anniversary of Guru Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche), the founder of Tibetan Buddhism. The courtyard of the monastery becomes a stage for the 'Cham' dance.\n\nLamas (monks) dressed in vibrant silk brocade robes and wearing terrifying masks representing deities and demons perform slow, rhythmic dances to the sound of cymbals, long horns (dung-chen), and drums. The dances enact the triumph of good over evil. Once every 12 years (Year of the Monkey), a massive two-story high 'Thangka' (religious scroll) is unfurled, making it exponentially more crowded and auspicious.",
