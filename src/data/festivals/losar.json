    "long_description": "Losar is the Tibetan New Year and welcomes both spring and the new lunar year, with each year linked to an animal and an element in the Tibetan calendar. It blends Buddhist religious observances with folk customs meant to drive away negativity and invite prosperity. Losar gives travellers a close look at Himalayan Buddhist life, with monasteries alive with chanting, incense, and ceremonial dances. High‑altitude towns such as Tawang or Leh feel transformed, with prayer flags, traditional dress, and community gatherings that make the cold season feel festive rather than harsh.",
