    "short_description": "The Festival of Lights, India's biggest celebration symbolizing the spiritual victory of light over darkness.",
    "long_description": "Diwali (or Deepavali) is the most eagerly awaited festival in India, a five-day celebration that illuminates the entire country. It commemorates the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile and his victory over the demon king Ravana. To welcome him, the people lit rows of clay lamps (diyas), a tradition that continues today, turning cities and villages into twinkling wonderlands.\n\nBeyond the lights, Diwali is a time of renewal. Homes are deep-cleaned and decorated with colorful rangoli patterns. Families gather to perform Lakshmi Puja, seeking blessings for prosperity and wealth. It is also equivalent to Christmas in terms of gift-giving; boxes of dry fruits and sweets (mithai) are exchanged between friends and neighbors. While firecrackers have traditionally been a huge part of the festivities, there is a growing shift towards 'Green Diwali' with eco-friendly celebrations. The energy during Diwali is palpable—markets are buzzy, homes are warm with hospitality, and the night sky is a canvas of fireworks.",
    "significance": "Diwali marks the triumph of good over evil. Spiritual seekers view it as the awakening of the inner light (Atman). For the business community, it marks the start of a new financial year.",
