    "long_description": "The Pushkar Camel Fair (Pushkar Mela) is one of the world's largest livestock fairs. For five days, the dunes around the holy town of Pushkar are taken over by 50,000 camels and livestock, brought by turbaned traders for sale. It is a photographer's paradise.\n\nBut it is not just commerce; it is a carnival. There are 'Matka Phod' competitions, 'Longest Moustache' contests, and camel races. Simultaneously, it is a devout pilgrimage. Pushkar is one of the few places with a temple dedicated to Lord Brahma. On Kartik Purnima, thousands of devotees wash away their sins in the sacred Pushkar Lake. The contrast between the dusty, noisy trade fair and the serene, chanting-filled ghats is what makes Pushkar unique.",
