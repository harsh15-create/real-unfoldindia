    "long_description": "Makar Sankranti marks the transition of the Sun into the zodiac sign of Capricorn (Makara), signaling the end of winter and the start of longer days. Unlike most Hindu festivals which follow the lunar cycle, this follows the solar cycle and usually falls on January 14th.\n\nWhile celebrated differently across India (Pongal in Tamil Nadu, Magh Bihu in Assam), the most visually spectacular celebration is 'Uttarayan' in Gujarat. The sky becomes a battlefield of kites. Millions of colorful paper kites fill the horizon, and the air resonates with shouts of 'Kai Po Che!' (I have cut the kite!). It is a day of rooftop parties, music, sunglasses, and eating 'undhiyu' (a mixed vegetable delicacy) and jaggery-sesame sweets.",
