    "long_description": "Pongal is one of the most important festivals in Tamil Nadu, marking the start of the sun's six-month long journey northwards (Uttarayan). It is essentially a thanksgiving festival to nature—the Sun, the Earth, and the cattle—that help in the harvest. The word 'Pongal' means 'to boil over', symbolizing prosperity and abundance. The signature ritual involves cooking fresh rice with jaggery and milk in a new clay pot until it boils over, with the family shouting 'Pongalo Pongal!'.\n\nCelebrated over four days, each day has a purpose. Bhogi Pongal is for discarding old belongings; Surya Pongal honors the Sun God; Mattu Pongal worships the cattle, where bulls are bathed, decorated, and honored (and sometimes engaged in the bull-taming sport Jallikattu); and Kaanum Pongal is for family reunions. The festival paints the state in vibrant kolams (floor designs), sugarcane stacks, and turmeric, offering a deep insight into the agrarian roots of Tamil culture.",
