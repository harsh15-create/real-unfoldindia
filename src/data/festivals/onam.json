    "long_description": "Onam is the state festival of Kerala, a grand ten-day spectacle that unites Malayalis across religious lines. It celebrates the homecoming of the mythical King Mahabali, a benevolent ruler whose spirit is believed to visit his subjects annually. The festival transforms the lush green state into a riot of colors starting with 'Pookkalam', intricate flower carpets designed in front of every home.\n\nThe highlight for travelers is the Vallam Kali (Snake Boat Race), where long, narrow boats powered by hundreds of singing oarsmen slice through the backwaters—a display of strength and rhythm. Another essential experience is the 'Onam Sadhya', a vegetarian feast of 26+ dishes served on a banana leaf. From the tiger dances (Pulikali) where joyously pot-bellied men paint themselves as tigers to the serene temple rituals, Onam captures the essence of Kerala's rich heritage.",
