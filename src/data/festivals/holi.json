    "short_description": "The vibrant Festival of Colors, celebrating the arrival of spring and the triumph of good over evil with playful color throwing.",
    "long_description": "Holi is perhaps India's most recognizable festival worldwide, a chaotic, joyous explosion of color that marks the arrival of spring. Ancient hindu mythology tells the story of Prahlad and Holika, symbolizing the burning of evil, which is enacted in the bonfire ritual of Holika Dahan on the eve of Holi. The next day, known as Rangwali Holi, is a free-for-all carnival of colors where social barriers dissolve. People of all ages, castes, and backgrounds chase each other with dry powder (gulal) and colored water, dance to drumbeats, and share festive sweets.\n\nBeyond the playfulness, Holi holds deep cultural significance as a day of forgiveness and renewal. It is a time when old grudges are forgotten, and relationships are mended with an embrace and a smear of red brightness. Regionally, the celebrations vary wildly—from the stick-beating Lathmar Holi in Barsana to the royal processions of Rajasthan and the musical gatherings in Bengal. For the traveler, Holi is an immersive experience that is intensely physical, visually stunning, and emotionally uplifting.",
    "significance": "Holi celebrates the victory of Vishnu's devotee Prahlad over the demoness Holika, signified by the lighting of bonfires (Holika Dahan). It also honors the divine love of Radha and Krishna, who famously played with colors in Vrindavan.",
