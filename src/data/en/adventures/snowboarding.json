    "long_description": "Snowboarding is the 'cool' younger sibling of skiing, inspired by surfing and skateboarding. Instead of two skis and poles, you are strapped sideways onto a single board. This setup makes it trickier to learn balance initially, but immensely rewarding once mastered, as the sensation creates a fluid 'surfing' motion on snow.\n\nGulmarg and Sethan (Hamta Valley) are the snowboarding capitals of India. The deep powder in Gulmarg is particularly suited for snowboarding as the wide board floats better than thin skis. A growing community of local snowboarders and instructors makes it accessible for beginners to learn.",
