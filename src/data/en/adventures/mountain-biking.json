    "long_description": "Mountain Biking (MTB) in India is synonymous with the Himalayas, but the diverse terrain offers trails across the country. The holy grail is the Manali-Leh highway—a multi-day endurance test over high passes. But for those seeking technical thrills, single-track riding (narrow trails) in places like Manali, Pune, and Sikkim offers world-class downhill and cross-country (XC) riding.\n\nYou ride specialized bicycles with suspension systems and knobby tires to handle rocks, roots, and mud. It’s an immersive way to cover ground, smelling the pine forests and feeling the gradient changes in your legs. Organized tours provide support vehicles, mechanics, and stays, making long expeditions accessible even to amateur enthusiasts.",
