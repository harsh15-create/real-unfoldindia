    "long_description": "Kayaking in India takes two distinct forms: leisurely flatwater kayaking and high-adrenaline white-water kayaking. For most travelers, the former is the lure—paddling silently through the backwaters of Kerala, the mangrove forests of the Andamans, or the rocky coastlines of Goa. It is an intimate way to experience nature, allowing you to venture into narrow canals and coves that larger boats cannot reach.\n\nThe Andaman Islands offer a spectacular 'Night Kayaking' experience where bioluminescence makes the water glow with every stroke of your paddle. In Kerala, kayaking tours often weave through village canals, offering a glimpse of local life. For the thrill-seekers, Rishikesh and Meghalaya offer white-water kayaking courses where you learn to navigate rapids, eskimo roll, and read the river currents.",
