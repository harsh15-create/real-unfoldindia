    "long_description": "Paragliding offers the closest experience to flying like a bird. It involves foot-launching from a hill or mountain slope while harnessed to a wide, canopy-like wing. Using rising currents of warm air (thermals) and wind, pilots can stay aloft for hours and cover vast distances.\n\nIn India, paragliding has grown from a niche sport to a major adventure attraction. The country boasts one of the world's best paragliding sites—Bir Billing in Himachal Pradesh—which hosted the Paragliding World Cup. But the sport isn't limited to the Himalayas; you can also glide over the lush Western Ghats in Kamshet, the endless plains of Gujarat, or the scenic tea gardens of Vagamon in Kerala.\n\nFlights are generally categorized into two types: Tandem and Solo. For most tourists, Tandem flights are the way to go. You are strapped securely in front of an experienced, licensed pilot who handles all the controls, leaving you free to enjoy the panoramic views and take photos. For those seeking to master the skies themselves, accredited schools offer 15-day courses to learn solo flying.\n\nThe sensation is surprisingly peaceful. After a few energetic steps during takeoff, the ground falls away, and the wind rushes past as you soar silently. Whether it's the adrenaline of a high-altitude cross-country flight or a gentle sunset glide, paragliding is an unforgettable way to see India from a new perspective.",
