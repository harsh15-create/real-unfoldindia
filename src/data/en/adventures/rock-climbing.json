    "long_description": "Rock climbing is a physically demanding sport that involves scaling natural rock faces or artificial walls. In India, it has evolved into a serious pursuit with world-class locations. Hampi, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is internationally famous as the 'Bouldering Capital of India', where climbers solve 'problems' on giant granite boulders scattered across the surreal landscape.\n\nBadami in Karnataka offers red sandstone cliffs perfect for traditional and sport climbing. Manali and Sethan provide high-altitude climbing experiences on granite faces. Whether you are bouldering (climbing short rocks without ropes, using crash pads) or sport climbing (using ropes and bolts for high cliffs), India offers terrain for all grades.\n\nBeginners can try 'Top Roping' where a rope is secured from above, making it 100% safe to fall. Courses taught by certified instructors help you learn knots, belaying, and movement techniques.",
