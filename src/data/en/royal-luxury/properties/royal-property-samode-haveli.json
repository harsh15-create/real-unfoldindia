    "long_description": "Samode Haveli is a traditional Indian mansion set in a verdant garden with apartments arranged around intimate courtyards. Built 175 years ago as a residence of the rulers of Samode, it is still occupied by their descendants, who have converted their home into an exquisite heritage hotel.\n\nThe Haveli is a quintessential Indo-Saracenic regal residence. A standout feature is the elephant ramp at the entrance, originally built in the 1940s for the marriage ceremony of a family member. Inside, the hand-painted dining hall and the intricate mirror work in the Sheesh Mahal suite are breathtaking. It offers a sanctuary of peace within the bustling walls of the old city.",
