    "long_description": "Chittoor Kottaram is uniqueness personified. It is a single-key hotel, which means when you book it, the entire palace is yours. There are no other guests. You live as the Raja of Cochin did, in his summer retreat built 300 years ago.\n\nThe palace is a wooden marvel situated right on the backwaters. You arrive by a private boat. The staff is dedicated entirely to you. The furniture, the architecture, and the atmosphere are exactly as they were centuries ago. It is a place of profound silence and privacy, where luxury is defined not by gold taps, but by the exclusivity of the experience.",
