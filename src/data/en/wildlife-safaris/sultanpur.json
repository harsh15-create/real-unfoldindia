    "long_description": "Sultanpur National Park is located at Sultanpur village on the Gurugram-Jhajjar highway, 15 km from Gurugram, Haryana. It is a favorite spot for bird watchers, especially during the winter months. Approximately 250 species of birds are found here. Some of them are resident, while others come from distant regions like Siberia, Europe and Central Asia. The park revolves around a freshwater lake which dries up in summer but brims with life in winter. It provides a convenient escape for nature lovers from the National Capital Region.",
