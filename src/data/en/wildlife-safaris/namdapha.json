    "long_description": "Namdapha National Park is the largest protected area in the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot and is located in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh. It is India's third largest national park. The park is a botanical and zoological treasure trove, with an altitude varying from 200 m to 4500 m. It is notoriously famous for being the only park in the world to harbour four feline species of big cats: Tiger, Leopard, Snow Leopard and Clouded Leopard. Its remote location and dense canopy keep much of it unexplored and pristine.",
